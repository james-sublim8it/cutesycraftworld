# Google Analytics Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Create a Google Analytics Account

1. Go to [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Start measuring"
4. Set up your account:
   - Account name: "Cutesy Craft World"
   - Property name: "Cutesy Craft World Website"
   - Industry category: "Arts & Entertainment"
   - Business size: Select appropriate size
5. Choose "Web" as your platform
6. Enter your website URL (when you have it live)

## Step 2: Get Your Measurement ID

1. After creating the property, you'll get a **Measurement ID** that looks like: `G-XXXXXXXXXX`
2. Copy this ID

## Step 3: Update Your Website

Replace `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` in your `index.html` file with your actual Measurement ID:

```html
<!-- Replace BOTH instances of GA_MEASUREMENT_ID with your actual ID -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXXX"></script>
<script>
    window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
    function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
    gtag('js', new Date());
    gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX');
</script>
```
